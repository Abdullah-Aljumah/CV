      <p>I am currently working as a senior front end developer on IAG's Chroma Design System team, however as there are only two developers on the team we have also been required to setup CI/CD workflows in Circle CI/Github Actions as well as hosting environments in AWS. I have had experience setting up deployments to S3 via the AWS CLI from Github Actions and setting up CloudFront, Route 53 and simple Lambda functions. I have also been responsible for creating and maintaining components both in our Core product which is html/scss and our React npm package which is consumed by the app development teams and setting up</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>Over the past 20 years I have continuously challenged myself with new languages, frameworks and methodologies. My core languages have always been html, css & javascript but I have also worked as a full stack php developer building both bespoke CMS solutions and small business applications. My current role at IAG is Senior Front End Developer (or Senior Software Engineer as IAG prefer to label us) and have been developing with React and Redux for the past 4 years.</p>
